| src/ML-try-007.ipynb | Was the final submission code                                                                     |
|                      | Sets up the notebook to use tensorboard.                                                          |
|                      | I doubt tensorboard works in watsonx - remove it                                                  |
|                      | Uses ./csv/usgs_gsvb_v2.csv for data                                                              |
|                      | The input has 9K rows and 8 columns                                                               |
|                      | Should break this up into a single file to generate the clean data including a yaml data contract |
|                      | adds new columns, normalizes the data                                                             |
|                      | -- cut off for cleaning data --                                                                   |
